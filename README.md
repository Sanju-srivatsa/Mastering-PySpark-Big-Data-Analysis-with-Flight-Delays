### **Introduction to PySpark**

PySpark is an open-source framework for distributed computing, designed for processing large-scale data efficiently. It supports:

- **Distributed Computing:** Automatically distributes data and computation across clusters.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Maintains data integrity despite node failures.
- **Ease of Use:** Python APIs simplify working with Spark’s distributed architecture.
- **Big Data Processing:** Efficiently handles datasets too large for single machines.
- **Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with tools like Hadoop, SQL, and Python libraries.

### **Core Components and Features**

1. **SparkSession**: Entry point to interact with Spark, managing configurations and clusters.
2. **RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets)**: Immutable, fault-tolerant collections for parallelized operations.
3. **DataFrames**: Structured data tables with schema support, optimized by Catalyst Optimizer.
4. **PySpark SQL**: Query structured data using SQL.
5. **MLlib**: Scalable library for machine learning tasks, such as classification, regression, and clustering.

   - Filter and group data for insights.
6. **SQL Queries**: Use SQL to analyze structured data.
7. **Machine Learning**:
   - Prepare features using VectorAssembler.
   - Train and evaluate models for predicting delays.
8. **Optimization**:
   - Repartition for parallelism.
   - Cache frequently used data.
9. **Visualization**:
   - Use Matplotlib and Pandas to plot insights like average delays and prediction distributions.
